## Introduction
SPGL1 is a solver for large-scale one-norm
regularized least squares.

It is designed to solve any of the following three problems:

1. Basis pursuit denoise (BPDN):
   ``minimize  ||x||_1  subject to  ||Ax - b||_2 <= sigma``,

2. Basis pursuit (BP):
   ``minimize   ||x||_1  subject to  Ax = b``

3. Lasso:
   ``minimize  ||Ax - b||_2  subject to  ||x||_1 <= tau``,

The matrix ``A`` can be defined explicitly, or as an operator
that returns both both ``Ax`` and ``A'b``.

SPGL1 can solve these three problems in both the real and complex domains.

## Installation

#### From PyPi

If you want to use ``spgl1`` within your codes, install it in your
Python environment by typing the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install spgl1
```

#### From Source

First of all clone the repo. To install ``spgl1`` within your current
environment, simply type:
```
make install
```
or as a developer:
```
make dev-install
```

To install ``spgl1`` in a new conda environment, type:
```
make install_conda
```
or as a developer:
```
make dev-install_conda
```


## Getting started
Examples can be found in the ``examples`` folder in the form of
jupyter notebooks.

## Documentation
The official documentation is built with Sphinx and hosted on
[readthedocs](https://spgl1.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
